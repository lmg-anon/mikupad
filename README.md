## Features

* **Multiple Backends**: Supports **llama.cpp**, **koboldcpp**, **AI Horde**, and any **OpenAI Compatible** API.
* **Session Persistence**: Your prompt is automatically saved and restored, allowing you to continue seamlessly across multiple sessions. Import and export sessions for sharing or maintaining backups.
* **Optional Server**: Can be hosted on a local Node.js server, enabling database access remotely or across your local network.
* **Persistent Context**:
  * **Memory**: Seamlessly inject a text of your choice at the beginning of the context.
  * **Author's Note**: Seamlessly inject a text of your choice at the end of the context, with adjustable depth.
  * **World Info**: Dynamically include extra information in the context, triggered by specific keywords.
* **Prediction Undo/Redo**: Easily experiment and refine your generated text with the ability to undo and redo predictions.
* **Token Probability**: Hover over any token to reveal the top 10 most probable tokens at that point. Click on a probability to regenerate the text from that specific token.
  * If you're using oobabooga, make sure to use an \_HF sampler for this feature to function properly.
  * If you're using koboldcpp, token probabilities are only available with Token Streaming disabled.
* **Logit Bias**: Fine-tune the generation process by adjusting the likelihood bias of specific tokens on-the-fly.
* **Completion/Chat Modes**:
  * **Completion**: Have the language model directly continue your prompt.
  * **Chat**: Mikupad simplifies using instruct models. It automatically adds the right delimiters when you start or stop generating, based on your selected template. This also structures your prompt into messages, making it compatible with the Chat Completions API (for OpenAI-compatible backends).
* **Themes**: Customize your environment by choosing from a variety of themes.
